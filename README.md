# TaskMaster
> Simple To-Do List Web Application

## Overview:
The To-Do List web application allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them when they're done. It provides a user-friendly interface to manage daily tasks efficiently.

## Technologies:
- HTML: For structuring the web page layout.
- CSS: For styling the elements, including fonts, colors, spacing, and layout.
- JavaScript (optional): For adding interactivity, such as adding tasks dynamically and updating their status.

## Features:

### Task Input:
- Display an input field where users can enter their tasks.
- Implement a button to submit the task.

### Task Display:
- Show the list of tasks entered by the user.
- Each task should have a checkbox to mark it as completed and a delete button.

### Add Task Functionality:
- Implement JavaScript to add tasks to the list dynamically when the user submits them.
- Clear the input field after adding a task.

### Mark Task as Completed:
- Allow users to mark a task as completed by checking the checkbox next to it.
- Apply CSS styles to visually distinguish completed tasks from active ones.

### Delete Task:
- Enable users to delete a task from the list by clicking on the delete button associated with it.
- Implement JavaScript functionality to remove the task from the list when deleted.

### Local Storage (Optional):
- Store tasks in the browser's local storage so that they persist even after the page is refreshed.
- Retrieve tasks from local storage when the page loads initially.

## Guidelines:

### Set Up the HTML Structure:
- Create an HTML file for the web page layout.
- Define the structure using appropriate HTML tags, such as ```<div>, <ul>, <li>, <input>, and <button>```.

### Style the To-Do List:
- Use CSS to style the elements, including fonts, colors, spacing, and layout.
- Apply CSS to make the To-Do List visually appealing and user-friendly.

### Implement Basic Functionality:
- Start by implementing basic functionality without JavaScript, such as adding tasks and displaying them on the page.

### Add JavaScript Interactivity (Optional):
- Use JavaScript to add interactivity to the To-Do List, such as adding tasks dynamically, marking tasks as completed, and deleting tasks.

### Test the Application:
- Test the To-Do List web application to ensure that it works as expected on different browsers and devices.
- Test the functionality, including adding tasks, marking them as completed, and deleting them.

### Optional Enhancements:
- Implement additional features such as editing tasks, sorting tasks by priority, or adding due dates.
- Improve the user interface with animations or transitions using CSS.
